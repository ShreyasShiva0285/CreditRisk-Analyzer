# CreditRisk-Analyzer

**CreditRisk-Analyzer** is a machine learning-based application designed to predict the credit risk of loan applicants. It leverages data analysis and modeling techniques to evaluate the likelihood of default and offers an insightful view into the applicant's financial health. This tool aims to assist financial institutions in making informed lending decisions.

## Project Overview

The CreditRisk-Analyzer utilizes various data science and machine learning techniques to assess the creditworthiness of applicants by analyzing multiple features such as income, employment status, and other financial metrics. The app is designed to be intuitive, offering real-time predictions with detailed visualizations for easy interpretation.

## Key Features

- **Loan Default Prediction**: Predicts whether a loan applicant is at risk of defaulting.
- **Interactive Data Visualizations**: Graphical representation of key metrics and predictions.
- **Real-Time Prediction**: Provides immediate credit risk analysis based on input data.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Built with Streamlit for an interactive and responsive user experience.

## Technologies Used

- **Machine Learning**: Scikit-learn, XGBoost
- **Data Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly
- **Frontend**: Streamlit (for real-time interactive interface)
- **Data Handling**: Pandas, Numpy
- **Model**: Random Forest, Logistic Regression, XGBoost

## Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ShreyasShiva0285/CreditRisk-Analyzer.git

2. Install Required Libraries
Make sure you have Python 3.7 or higher installed. Then, you can install the required dependencies via pip:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Run the Application
After installing the dependencies, you can run the Streamlit app with the following command:

bash
Copy
Edit
streamlit run app.py
How it Works
Data Input: Users input various applicant information (e.g., income, loan amount, credit score, etc.) through an interactive form.

Prediction Model: The backend machine learning model processes the data and returns a prediction about whether the applicant is a high or low risk.

Output: The app provides a prediction along with an explanation of the results based on the applicantâ€™s input data. It also offers visual insights into the risk factors that contributed to the decision.

Use Case
This tool is highly applicable in the finance industry, particularly for banks and financial institutions that need to evaluate the risk of lending to individuals or businesses. The model can help in automating credit risk analysis, making it faster, more accurate, and data-driven.
